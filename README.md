# [CDKit](https://github.com/timoa/cdkit): ReleaseScripts

*[CDKit](https://github.com/timoa/cdkit) is a framework that helps to deploy mobile apps (iOS and Android) to the app stores (iTunes and Goole Play).*

## Getting started

The release scripts are Python 3 scripts that help to do tasks like changing version of the app based on the pipeline version, create the changelog file based on the last commits, export iOS *.app to *.ipa file, etc.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using it, you need to have installed Python 3 on the Go.CD agent(s)

### Install Python 3

#### Linux

Please refer to this page to [install Python 3 for Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-programming-environment-on-ubuntu-18-04-quickstart)

#### macOS

If you installed previously Homebrew, let's use it to install Python 3 with this command:

``` bash
brew install python
```


## TODO
* Migrate all the scripts to Python 3
